sideloading guide

hello there and today we will steal your dat- we will jailbreak your device.
first step is to download the app your viewing this in
second step is to click on the "Configruation Profiles" button and select "madNS config profile"
third step is to click on portal and click on "Portal - Continent" (if it doesnt work try the other ones until it works)                                                                
fourth step is to open this app again and click on "Certificates", you will be asked to download a folder, click yes and save it to files.
fifth step is to open portal and click on "Downloads", then scroll down until you see "Scarlet" and remember how you tried each portal type until it worked? we have to use that now, for example if you clicked "Portal - Insurance" you would have to click on "Scarlet - Insurance"
